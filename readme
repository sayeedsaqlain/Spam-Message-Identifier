This is NLP based project where the prime focus is on identifying the spam messages from a large dataset.
The messages are classified as ham and spam.
Various natural language techniques such as tokenization, stop word removal, punctuation removal, case conversion etc are done
on the messages to obtain relevant keywords which contribute largely in identifying spam messages.
Finally the model is built and ensemble learning is implemented to compare accuracy.
I used Random Forest and obtained an accuracy of ~95%.
